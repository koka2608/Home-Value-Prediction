Predicting Home Values Using Zillow Data: A Comprehensive Machine Learning Approach to Understanding Housing Market Trends, Rent Affordability, and Market Competitiveness

The housing market is a critical component of economic stability and individual financial planning. This project leverages Zillow’s extensive datasets, including metrics like the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI), Price-to-Rent Ratios, and Market Heat Index, to build predictive models for home values across regions. Using a Random Forest Regressor, we achieved an R² score of 0.885, demonstrating strong predictive power. Feature importance analysis revealed that Price-to-Rent Ratio is the most significant driver of home values, followed by year-over-year changes in rents and housing prices.

Our machine learning approach not only predicts home values but also provides valuable insights into the dynamics of affordability, rental demand, and market competitiveness. These insights enable stakeholders, including policymakers, real estate investors, and homeowners, to make informed decisions. Future work includes enhancing the model with additional features, such as economic indicators and localized housing policies, and exploring advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting for improved accuracy. This project underscores the potential of AI in unraveling complex housing market dynamics and empowering data-driven decision-making.
